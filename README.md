# Snake-game
The following are the steps into which I have broken the project into-
TODO 1) make snake body
Here we will make the snake body using the graphics user interface library used turtle.

TODO 2) movement of snake
We will make the snake body to move in all four direction using the arrow keys across the screen.

TODO 3) create snake food
We will be creating the food.

TODO 4) detect collision with food
On collison with the food the food will randomly place in some other location of the screen.

TODO 5) create scoreboard
On collision with food the score should increase by some value everytime.

Some conditions when the game should over.
TODO 6) detect collision with wall
Whenever the snake body collided with the wall the game should over.
TODO 7) detect collision with tail
The snake head colliding with anyother part of the body leads to game over.
